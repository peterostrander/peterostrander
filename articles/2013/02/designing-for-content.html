        <h1 class="headline">Designing for Content</h1>
        <p>Four weeks ago I began attending the Starter League's inaugural Visual Design course, prepared and presented by 37signal's <a href="http://migreyes.com" target="_blank">Mig Reyes</a>. Up until that point, I'd never had any kind of formal education or training in design; even though I've been working professionally as a web developer and designer for the better part of a decade. Turns out I've been doing it wrong for awhile.</p>
        <p>In week one, Mig stressed the idea that &mdash; even with all the fancy gradients, 3d transforms, and rounded corners &mdash; <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3404-reminder-design-is-still-about-words" target="_blank">design is still about words</a>.</p>
        <p>This was somewhat of a revelation. The process of designing something around existing content isn't new to me, but being aware of that process is. I think that's an important distinction.</p>
        <p>I've designed plenty of websites where the content is vast, and the process of designing for that content comes naturally. But I've also created websites where the copy is non-existent and the only instructions from the client are, "build me a website."</p>
        <p>In the latter situation, it would take me forever to get into the groove of things. I'd start with building a header, but that would get me nowhere. I'd move onto the body of the design&hellip; but without any content, I'd go through endless iterations. When I finally hit a dead end, I'd give up and start writing some copy. Inevitably, that made going back to the design work much easier.</p>
        <p>Design is hard, but it's nearly impossible when you have nothing to design for.</p>
